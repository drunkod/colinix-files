# TODO: could use dduper: https://github.com/Lakshmipathi/dduper
#   like rmlint, but better perf for btrfs (checksum tests)
#   likely also better compression, on account of being block-based instead of whole-file based.
#   however, not clearly actively maintained; uses custom btrfs-progs patch; riskier
#     might not currently build on nix: https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/175730
