# when a `nixos-rebuild` fails after a nixpkgs update:
# - take the failed package
# - search it here: <https://hydra.nixos.org/search?query=pkgname>
# - if it's broken by that upstream builder, then pin it: somebody will come along and fix the package.
# - otherwise, search github issues/PRs for knowledge of it before pinning.
# - if nobody's said anything about it yet, probably want to root cause it or hold off on updating.
#
# note that these pins apply to *all* platforms:
# - natively compiled packages
# - cross compiled packages
# - qemu-emulated packages

  # XXX: when invoked outside our flake (e.g. via NIX_PATH) there is no `next.stable`,
  # so just forward the unstable packages.
