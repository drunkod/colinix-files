# disable tests for packages which flake.
# tests will fail for a variety of reasons:
# - they were coded with timeouts that aren't reliable under heavy load.
# - they assume a particular architecture (e.g. x86) whereas i compile on multiple archs.
# - they assume too much about their environment and fail under qemu.
