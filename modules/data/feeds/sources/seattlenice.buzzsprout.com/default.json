  "description": "It\u2019s getting harder and harder to talk about politics, especially if you disagree. Well, screw that. Seattle Nice aims to be the most opinionated and smartest analysis of what\u2019s really happening in Seattle politics available in any medium. Each episode dives into contentious and sometimes ridiculous topics, exploring perspectives from across Seattle's political spectrum, from city council brawls to the ways the national political conversation filters through our unique political process. Even if you\u2019re not from Seattle, you need to listen to Seattle Nice. Because it\u2019s coming for you. Unlike the sun, politics rises in the West and sets in the East.",
