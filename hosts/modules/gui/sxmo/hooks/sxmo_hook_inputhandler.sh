# input map considerations
# - using compound actions causes delays.
#   e.g. if volup->volup is a distinct action from volup, then single-volup action is forced to wait the maximum button delay.
# - actions which are to be responsive should therefore have a dedicated key.
# - a dedicated "kill" combo is important for unresponsive fullscreen apps, because appmenu doesn't show in those
#   - although better may be to force appmenu to show over FS apps
# - bonsai mappings are static, so buttons can't benefit from non-compounding unless they're mapped accordingly for all lock states
#   - this limitation could be removed, but with work
#
# proposed future design:
# - when unlocked:
#   - volup-release   -> app menu
#     - volup-hold    -> WM menu
#   - voldown-release -> toggle keyboard
#     - voldown-hold  -> terminal
#   - pow-volup xN    -> volume up
#   - pow-voldown xN  -> volume down
#   - pow-x2          -> screen off
#   - pow-hold -> kill app
# - when screenoff:
#   - volup    -> volume up
#   - voldown  -> volume down
#   - pow-x1   -> screen on
#   - pow-x2   -> toggle player
#   - pow-volup -> seek +30s
#   - pow-voldown -> seek -10s
# benefits:
# - volup and voldown are able to be far more responsive
#   - which means faster vkbd, menus, volume adjustment (when locked)
# - less mental load than the chording-based approach (where i hold power to adjust volume)
# - less risk due to not chording the power button
# drawbacks:
# - volup/down actions are triggered by the release instead of the press; slight additional latency for pulling open the keyboard
#   - moving the WM menu into the top-level menu could allow keeping voldown free of complication

# increments to use for volume adjustment
VOL_INCR=5
