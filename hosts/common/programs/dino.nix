# usage:
# - start a DM with a rando via
#   - '+' -> 'start conversation'
# - add a user to your roster via
#   - '+' -> 'start conversation' -> '+'  (opens the "add contact" dialog)
#   - this triggers a popup on the remote side asking them for confirmation
#   - after the remote's confirmation there will be a local popup for you to allow them to add you to their roster
# - to make a call:
#   - ensure the other party is in your roster
#   - open a DM with the party
#   - click the phone icon at top (only visible if other party is in your roster)
#
# dino can be autostarted on login -- useful to ensure that i always receive calls and notifications --
# but at present it has no "start in tray" type of option: it must render a window.
#
# outstanding bugs:
# - mic is sometimes disabled at call start despite presenting as enabled
#   - fix is to toggle it off -> on in the Dino UI
# - default mic gain is WAY TOO MUCH (heavily distorted)
# - TODO: dino should have more optimal niceness/priority to ensure it can process its buffers
#   - possibly this is solved by enabling RealtimeKit (rtkit)
# - TODO: see if Dino calls work better with `echo full > /sys/kernel/debug/sched/preempt`
#
# probably fixed:
# - once per 1-2 minutes dino will temporarily drop mic input:
#   - `rtp-WRNING: plugin.vala:148: Warning in pipeline: Can't record audio fast enough
#   - this was *partially* fixed by bumping the pipewire mic buffer to 2048 samples (from ~512)
#   - this was further fixed by setting PULSE_LATENCY_MSEC=20.
#   - possibly Dino should be updated internally: `info.rate / 100` -> `info.rate / 50`.
#     - i think that affects the batching for echo cancellation, adaptive gain control, etc.
